# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable is a variable that is assigned to every instance of a class or class that is extended from the class it is assigned. It acts like "state" variables do in React, they allow you to keep a variable assigned to a class.

  Researched answer: A variable that is defined in a class and assigned to each object that is constructed from that class. 



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is a defined section of code used to organize your code, keep it mentally clean, and understand what each portion of a large project does. 

  Researched answer: Chunks of code between a do ... end or braces that allow you to group sections of code or use an entire section of code as a function parameter. 



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: If a return statement is not given, Ruby will automatically return the last line of a block, function, etc. 

  Researched answer: Any statement in Ruby will return the last evaluated line automatically. 



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm where data is stored in the code as well as functions. Object oriented programming uses datat types like arrays and objects to store data to manipulate. Functional programming is strictly layers of functions and processes, data is given to the functional program after the fact. 

  Researched answer: The most popular object oriented programming languages are class based meaning objects are instances of classes. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object. Each object that is constructed from that class is generally known as an instance. 

  Researched answer: Pretty much the same thing. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- PostgreSQL - A system to manage relational databases that is free and open-source. It places a strong emphasis on SQL compliance and extensibility, and is the default database for macOS Server.

- API - Application programming interface. It acts as an interface in which to handle and manage interactions between two or more software intermediaries. APIs are used extensively across the internet to essentially handle the flow of information from one source to another. This is what allows search engines, travel sites, etc to function and "pull" data from other sites. 

- CRUD - Create, read, update, delete. It is an acronym for all the basic functions of a relational database application. These are the ways in which it can interact with pieces of data. 

- Ruby on Rails - A web application framework written in Ruby. Similar to how React uses a large pool of code to allow developers to execute more complicated things with their websites and applications easier, Ruby on Rails allows people to create things in Ruby easier. 

- ORM - Object-relational mapping. A technique programmers use to transfer data between incompatible type systems using key-value pairs in object oriented programming. 

- Active Record - An approach used to access data in a relational database. It relies on the properties of classes and objects in object-oriented programming languages to quickly and efficiently read and update data.
